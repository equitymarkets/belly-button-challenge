# Belly Button Bacteria

What bacteria lie in the human navel? As it turns out, more than you might expect, and if you don't scrub, even more than that!

This study aims to answer the question by using a breakdown of different operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, that were found in a sample of people in the US. 

To get the baseball card, I had to isolate each data point, first loading the first record in the set, which is ID 940. Then based on user input via the dropdown, the meta data will change and fill in the appropriate fields. 

Next came the chart. Similar to the baseball card, I loaded the first record, then based the new visualizations on the user's input via the dropdown. 

I placed the source code for the gauge chart in the bonus.js file. Similar to the above, on the bonus gauge chart, I loaded the first records, then pulled the field "wfreq" from the source file to populate the gauge. 

Lastly, on the bubble chart I loaded the first record then populated the bubble chart with size based on amount of each OTU in the patient's navel.
